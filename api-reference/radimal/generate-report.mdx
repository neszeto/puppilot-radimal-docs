- The `report_id` field is required and is used to uniquely identify this report.
- For each condition in the predictions:
  - If normal: recommends the normal statement
  - If abnormal: recommends the mild statement
  - If absent: no statements are generated
- The `combined_report` uses the recommended statements to create a complete report.
